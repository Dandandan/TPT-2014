###Exercise 1 
Consice formulation for vmap. Imaginary bonus points for giving proof that the 
short version of vmap is the same as the direct definition (vmap'). 

###Exercise 2
* madd: Genius solution! (same as mine)
* idMatrix: This isn't correct. idMatrix {n} produces a nxn matrix filled with
only n's. -0.3
* transpose: I think you pattern matched one layer deeper than needed. -0.1 for style.

###Exercise 3
Same as Wouter's solution.

###Exercise 4
Same as Wouter's solution.

###Exercise 5
Practically the same solution as Wouter.

###Exercise 6
Looks good.

###Exercise 7 (Peirce's law)
Great, as far as I understand it.

###Exercise 8 (LEQ)
Same as Wouter's solution.

###Exercise 9
Cool!
