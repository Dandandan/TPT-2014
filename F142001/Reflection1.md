Overall, my solutions were correct and matched the solutions presented in the example document. Occasionally, the other student I reviewed had found a shorter or more elegant solution than mine/Wouter's, but I do not feel my own solutions were wrong.

####What I learned
In exercise 7, where we had to define our own data type `LEQ`, I found out that the choice of definition of the data type really determined the ease with which the rest of the functions could be defined. My solution matched Wouter's, but the other student had made a slightly different choice and had to use a lot of auxiliary lemma's in order to do the exercise. I will keep this in mind for later work -- whenever stuck, take a step back and reconsider the data type definitions.

In exercise 9, I took great care to construct the scoped lambda terms in such a way that variables could be assigned arbitrary numbers as names (instead of just deBruijn indices). This overcomplicated things a bit.
