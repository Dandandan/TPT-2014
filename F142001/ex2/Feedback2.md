## Exercise2a - initial holes
The big step semantics datatype is correct.
All holes have been filled in correctly.

**3/3 points**

## Exercise2a - adding pairs, fst and snd and extending the proofs
As you've mentioned, you have implemented the functionality of arbitrary n-tuples,
instead of the more specific pair functionality.
I've tried my best to review this part, but I've had a difficult time myself when
extending Exercise2a with pairs. My remarks are lacking in depth.

* Tuple was added to the available types, terms and values.
* Denotational semantics have been extended correctly.
* Small step semantics datatype has been extended correctly.
* Big step semantics datatype has been extended correctly.
* All proofs have been extended and make sense.

## Exercise2b - completing the termination proof of the simply typed lambda calculus
All holes have been filled in correctly.

## Adjusted total:
3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = **10**
