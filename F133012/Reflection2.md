## Exercise 2a

My approach of adding pairs was fairly different than the standard solution.
I used explicit proofs that a given term is a value, instead of using
the Is-Value predicate. Although I need some extra arguments to my constructors,
using the rewrite keyword with this proofs is very simple and effective.

The worst part of my exercise was my prepend-steps function. It is an ugly
monolithic function, for which I am not proud of.

I will assign myself `2.5` for filling in the holes and `3` for adding pairs.

## Exercise 2b

I didn't have any problem with this exercise. My code is structured
and functions have a fair size. Yet, a few more lemmas could have been used
to make the general line of the proof more understandable.
I will assign myself a `2.5`.

## Final Mark

`2.5 + 2.5 + 3 + 1 = 9`
