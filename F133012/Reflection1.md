The only real differences between my exercise and the solution set
is the last exercise, for which I argue that it is possible to always
find a scope in which a given lambda term is closed. It is
a bit more general and allows one to implement the proposed
check function regardless.

Some minor details could be pointed, though. I should have recognized
`step1` as being `dn notNotExcludedMiddle`, it is a more elegant solution.
