#### Exercise 1:

Almost identical, definition of vmap more elegant.  1.0


#### Exercise 2:

Similar solution, some auxilary functions used for madd. 0.95


#### Exercise 3: 

Identical solution. 1.0


#### Exercise 4:

Almost identical solution, a lemma used to omit a with statement. 1.0


#### Exercise 5:

Elegant solutions, especially catamorphism on natural numbers as well as very concise proof for distributivity. 1.0


#### Exercise 6:

Similar solutions, SubListTrans proven without a lemma, SubListAntiSym uses several auxilary lemmas but the resulting proof is concise and readable. 1.0


#### Exercise 7:

step1 misses similarity with notNotExcludedMiddle, provided logical equivalences and point-free operators demonstrate that the assignment was well understood. Pierces law proven, imaginary bonus points for proving it's dual. 1.2


#### Exercise 8:

Very similar solutions (leqTrans pattern matches when not necessary). 1.0


#### Exercise 9:

Very different and elaborate solution. The given solution modifies given data types and makes use of numerous auxilary functions, however it does implement scope checking. 0.9


#### Summary:

Almost flawless submission with only tiny remarks here and there. As a bonus Pierce's law and it's dual was proven. Implementation of exercise 9 was overly complicated, yet a correct solution was given.
