I've learned that my implementation of exercise 9 may be somewhat overcomplicated. On the other hand, my data type forces terms to be well-scoped (the implementation I graded relied on the scope-checking function to be used).
Other exercises were implemented quite similar to my solution.

The only negative feedback I got was that SubListTrans isn't correct, but it compiles, so it's a proof, so I give myself a 10.
