Overall: comments could be nice.
1: Correct.
2: separate vadd is clean, minor note: requires extra 'lookup' for reading, but worth it.
3: Correct.
4: cmp is fine, though style-wise some may prefer the lecturer-solution. 'difference' is off-by-one unfortunately.
5: rewrite is new to me, but interesting. Seems complete. Distributivity not completed. The lecturer solutions provide more insight than I could provide...
6: I'm pretty sure 'sublisttrans' has a slight mistake. Behaviour for matching on (Drop xs) (Drop ys)  and (Keep xs) (Drop ys) is the same, which I'm slightly sure should not be the case. The rest seems correct.
7: This all seems correct.
8: Correct. Pierces is incomplete.
9: Only started with the scoped type.
