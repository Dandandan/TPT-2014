## I. filling in the holes in the initial exercise 2a

Some parts are missing... **1.5/3 points**.

## II. adding pairs, fst and snd and extending the proofs

Good attempt at staying close to Pierce's book's theory. Nice `progress` proof. Sadly incomplete parts in other areas. **1.5/3 points**.

## III. completing the termination proof of the simply typed lambda calculus

Srong start, but then the more difficult proofs are missing. **1/3 points**.

## Adjusted total:

1.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 1 = **5**
