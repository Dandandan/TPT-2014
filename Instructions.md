# How to mark exercises

* Add a file 'Feedback1.md' to the directory of the student you are
  marking, giving feedback about his or her work. (For later
  exercises, use the name 'Feedback2.md' or 'Feedback3.md').

* Add a file 'Reflection1.md' to your own directory, where you discuss
  the things you learned from comparing the solution set to your own
  work. (For later exercises, use the name 'Reflection2.md' or
  'Reflection3.md').

* Update the file 'Marks.csv' with the marks for your own and your
  fellow student's work. Be very careful when editing this file!

* Create a pull request with these three changes.
