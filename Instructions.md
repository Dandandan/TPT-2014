# How to mark exercises

* Add a file 'Feedback1.md' to the directory of the student you are
  marking, giving feedback about his or her work.

* Add a file 'Reflection1.md' to your own directory, where you discuss
  the things you learned from comparing the solution set to your own
  work.

* Update the file 'Marks.csv' with the marks for your own and your
  fellow student's work.
