I've uploaded the second exercise set. This exercise consists of two parts: you will need to complete several proofs for the language with booleans and natural numbers (and extend it with tuples); the second part consists of completing the normalization proof for the simply typed lambda calculus. If you have any questions or spot inconsistencies, please don't hesitatet to get in touch.
