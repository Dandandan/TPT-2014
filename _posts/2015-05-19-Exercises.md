I've uploaded the [second exercise set](https://github.com/wouter-swierstra/TPT-2014/tree/master/exercises). This exercise consists of two parts: you will need to complete several proofs for the language with booleans and natural numbers (and extend it with tuples); the second part consists of completing the normalization proof for the simply typed lambda calculus. If you have any questions or spot inconsistencies, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
