The file [Bool.agda](https://github.com/wouter-swierstra/TPT-2014/blob/gh-pages/slides/Bool.agda) from the last lecture is now online. It defines three styles of semantics for a tiny programming language and proves several properties of this semantics.

Also, we've updated the [schedule](http://wouter-swierstra.github.io/TPT-2014/schedule.html), planning all the paper presentations, and added a description of what we [expect from your presentation](http://wouter-swierstra.github.io/TPT-2014/material.html)

I've updated the schedule with new deadlines surrounding the projects. The [proofs we covered today](https://github.com/wouter-swierstra/TPT-2014/blob/gh-pages/slides/BoolNat.agda) are now also online.

Finally, we now also have a more detailed description of the [project proposals](http://wouter-swierstra.github.io/TPT-2014/projects.html) available.
