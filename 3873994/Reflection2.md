## Filling in the holes in the initial exercise 2a

Implemented correctly.
I used less lemmas at the soundness proof, but it is still correct.
3 points.

## Adding pairs, fst and snd and extending the proofs

My Step was not entirely correct. I should have used values in stead of terms at E-FstTuple/E-SndTuple.
This is the reason why I was unable to finish the deterministic function and give the implicit arguments at prepend-step.
The valuesDoNotStep method is easier than I thought.
2.6 points.

## Completing the termination proof of the simply typed lambda calculus

Did not implement closure-normalization completely. This "normal-values" function would have made my life a whole lot easier. 2.6 points.
