## Exercise 1

Almostly Identical to Wouter's solution.
function pure could've been solved with only 2 pattern match cases.
However, this is a minor 'mistake'. **1pt**

## Exercise 2

Good solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 3

Practically identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 4

Identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 5

Good solutions, except for the distributivity proof (which hasn't been defined at all). **0.8pt**

## Exercise 6

Good solution, not fully complete on SubListAntiSym. **0.9pt**

## Exercise 7 (LEQ)

Practically identical to Wouter's solution. **0.9pt**

## Exercise 8 (Constructive logic)

Solutions are correct for implemented parts. Missing `step2` and `step3`. **0.6pt**

## Exercise 9

Not implemented. **0pt**
