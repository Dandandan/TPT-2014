# Reflection

The following observations were made when comparing the submission with the ideal solution:

* Some solutions make use of unnecessary pattern matching
* Multiple auxillary functions defined for second exercise, more elegant solution would have made better use of applicative
* Several proofs contain unnecessary steps
* Some important lemmas were omitted and due to that not all subassignments were finished
* My SubListTrans proof is more concise than the given answer
* step1 redefines notNotExcludedMiddle
