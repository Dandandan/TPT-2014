Grade:

Completing 2a: 1
Adding Pairs: 0
Completing 2b: 0

Total: 2

The idea behind Big-Step semantics is that for any given term, the big-step evaluation of that term is its final value. 
The easiest way to see if your Big-Step semantics are good, is to see if they are both sound and complete.

For the future, you should start earlier so you can hand in both the completion of 2a (this was the easiest part of the entire exercise),
made an attempt at pairs (this is again doable until it becomes very complicated) and made an attempt at 2b.

When you start early, there is also enough time that when you do run into problems, you can ask other students or Wouter for help.
