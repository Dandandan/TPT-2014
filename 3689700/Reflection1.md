Overall: Clearly, I had not spent enough time on the exercise. The exercises that I got to myself were fine --- those that I had not gotten to were a bit hard to grasp. With Agda, I feel that the real mind-bending happens when you try to do it yourself. Some minor tricks were revealed to me --- I did not know that _+_ could be used equivalently to (λ x y → x + y), for example


| Ex 1 | Ex 2 | Ex 3 | Ex 4 | Ex 5 | Ex 6 | Ex 7 | Ex 8 | Ex 9 | +1 | TOTAL |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|----|-------|
| 1    | 0.25 | 1    | 0    | 0.75 | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 1  | 4     |
