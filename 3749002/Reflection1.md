# Reflection 3749002

- Some solutions could have been more generic, e.g. a zip function instead of a function that adds the members of two vectors.
- In exercise 4 I slightly prefer my own implementation over the one I graded (3800296) because it delegates the difficult recursion case to a different function. This is nitpicking, though.
- the ⟨ ⟩ stuff I saw is super fancy. It makes the proof much clearer, that is if it compiles.
- My (partial) distributivity proof is messy, but then again I didn't know about the ⟨ ⟩ stuff.
- In Exercise 7 I could have shortened some definitions and replace needless pattern matches with variables.
- Exercise 9 doesn't have any proofs in the datatype. It would have been more Agdacool if they did.

Grading:
- -0.2 for the hole in distributivity.
- -0.2 for the holes in the lemma for SubListAntiSym (I /almost/ got it!)
- -0.3 for missing step3 and PiercesLaw
