Exercise    Points
1-4         1
5           0.5     Distributivity isn't proven, which is by far the hardest proof of part 5
6           0.7     AntiSymmetry not proven, but on the right track
7           1
8           0.7     Step3 and piercesLaw missing. You can avoid a lot of lambdas with pattern matching, as Not P is just a function, but I guess this is a matter of taste.
9           1       Your data type is just a Maybe, it doesn't actually force the terms to be well-scoped. I'm not sure if this was necessary, so full points.
