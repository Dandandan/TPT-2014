Somehow a lot of functions are now colored red in agda, which wasn't the case when I compiled it earlier. Weird. Might have something to do with the tuple cases, but I'm not sure where this happened.

## Exercise 1
All holes filled.

## Exercise 2
Prepend-step isn't completed for E-Fst and E-Snd. Also couldn't get soundness working for fst and snd.
-1.5

## Exercise 3
There's also some functions here colored red, this definitely wasn't the case when I first wrote them. Might be because agda lost some information from earlier pattern matching.

Couldn't get closure-normalization working.
