## Exercise 1

Identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 2

Good and readable solution of `madd`. Slightly more verbose `transpose` implementation, but still correct. **1pt**

## Exercise 3

Slightly more contrived solution for `correct`. Still correct though. **1pt**

## Exercise 4

Good solution. You can leave out implicit arguments when you don't use them for readability. Your `difference` function has an off-by-one error. **0.9pt**

## Exercise 5

Interesting use of notation to circumvent the use of `cong`. Implementation looks sound. Sadly, `difference` is incomplete. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 6

Different solution for `SubListTrans` than Wouter. If the type checker accepts it, then so do I. Missing `SubListAntiSym`. **0.6pt**

## Exercise 7 (Constructive logic)

Solutions are correct for implemented parts. Missing `step3`. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 8 (LEQ)

Interesting solution for `leq<=`, but much more complicated than the reference solution. Missing `<=leq`. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 9

Not implemented. **0pt**
