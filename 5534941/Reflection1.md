## Exercise 1

We have the same answers here (except he provides some implicit arguments). **1pt**

## Exercise 2

`madd`:
We all three, have a different implementation.
The other student and I both used pattern matching on
the matrices and use recursion in the Cons x xs parts.
He should have been using vmap though, instead of creating
vadd which essentially does the same.

`idMatrix`:
I've used the same solution as the one provided.
The solution of the other user seems to be right,
but he made it a lot more complicated then needed.

`transpose`:
We all three have different solutions again,
but the other student and I came close with our solutions.
He made a useless method 'replicate' though which is simply
a renamed copy of 'pure'.
The main difference between the other student and I,
is that I pattern match on the implicit m and n
and he pattern matches on the Matrix.

## Exercise 3

`plan`:
I did the same as the solution.
The other student used an intermediate method toFind,
which did make his solution more complicated then needed,
but it still works fine.

`forget` and `embed`:
All three used the same solution.

`correct`:
The other student did same as solution.
I used recursive call instead of cong, but it still works fine.
Just more complicated then it could have been.

## Exercise 4

We all three used the same solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 5

`plusZero`:
Here the difference between myself and the other two is the use of cong again.

`plusSucc`:
Same as plusZero.

`plusCommutes`:
Same as plusZero

`distrubutivity`:
I wasn't able to do more then the base cases.
The other student did have a solution, although different it seems to be correct.

## Exercise 6

The other student and I had mostly the same answer as the solution.
The only thing we didn't have is the use of magic. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 7 (LEQ)

The other student and I both didn't have <=leq fully right. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 8 (Constructive logic)

The other student and I both had the first three correct.
I also had the fourth one. **0.8pt**

## Exercise 9

I didn't do this one.
The other student referenced the tutorial,
but did not write any code. **0pt**
