## Exercise 1

Identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 2

`madd` was implemented with an auxiliry `vadd` function. Functionality is the same. Slightly more verbose `transpose` implementation, but still correct. **1pt**

## Exercise 3

Identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 4

Auxiliry function `cmp-succ` used for implementing `cmp`. This wasn't required, but neither readablility nor functionality is inhibited by introducing this function. **1pt**

## Exercise 5

All the `plus*` proofs are equal to Wouter's solution. The distributivity proof (the most difficult one from this exercise) was also done with the semantics introduced in class. Even though my solution is more verbose, it works and it easy to follow. **1pt**

## Exercise 6

Solutions are all correct. Less verbose `SubListAntiSym` thanks to an auxiliry proof. Looks great! **1pt**

## Exercise 7 (Constructive logic)

The proof for `step2` is slightly different, but still valid. **1pt**

## Exercise 8 (LEQ)

Identical to Wouter's solution. **1pt**

## Exercise 9

Not implemented. **0pt**
