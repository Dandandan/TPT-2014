## Part 1
Everything is implemented sensibly. 3 points.

## Part 2
Not implemented

## Part 3
`clapp-normalization` is implemented sensibly. 0.5

`normalizableStep` not implemented. Attempt was made to pattern match, but the wrong thing was pattern matched.
`normalizableSteps` not implemented.
`closure-normalization` not implemented.
`normalizable-env` not implemented.
`normalization` not implemented.
`termination` not implemented. An attempt was made to pattern match, but calls to normalizable-terminates and normalization should have provided the solution instead.

0.5 points for `clapp-normalization`, 0.1 for the effort on the other two.
0.6 points.
