# Reflection

* Multiple auxillary functions defined in some of the first couple of exercises
* The distributivity proof in exercise 5 could've been implemented with a lot less code (most of the unnecesary code could've been prevented by using the symmetry rule to proof a reverse of a lemma, instead of defining the reverse of a lemma using a dedicated function)
* step1 redefines notNotExcludedMiddle
