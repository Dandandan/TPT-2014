# Reflection

There's honestly not a lot that I can reflect on.

* My solutions for the first part of exercise2a are fine.
* I simply didn't have enough time to finish the second part of exercise2a.
* My solutions for exercise2b are fine, except for 2 holes. Again, not because I got stuck, but
because I didn't have enough time.
